🛍️ Project Description: Pinterest-Inspired E-Commerce Platform
Imagine Pinterest — but better. A platform where inspiration meets action. Instead of just discovering beautiful ideas and then being redirected to external merchant websites, this platform lets users shop directly from their favorite creators or support small businesses — all in one seamless experience.

I built a full-fledged Pinterest clone where every button is functional and every page is designed with a complete user interface. The standout feature is the Shop section, where users can:

🔍 Search for creators or small businesses

🛍️ Browse products directly on their page

🛒 Add items to a cart, view the total, and enter a delivery address

💳 Proceed to a payment page after placing the order

📦 Track the delivery status with a detailed timeline

✏️ Change or cancel the order at any time

The user journey is intuitive and smooth — from discovery to purchase to delivery.

This project is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing how a complete e-commerce flow can be implemented using front-end technologies alone
